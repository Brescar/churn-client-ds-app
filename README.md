# Churn / Client - data science assignment
Given a prepared dataset of information with a bank's clients, I have developed a machine learning model to identify the clients with are most likely to be churners. Developed in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains some explanations.

## Background
"You are a Data Scientist at Delta Bank, a company that is aiming to develop a customer experience vision. 
Part of this vision, one important pillar is the customers retention. As a result, the business officers would 
want to strengthen the relationship with the clients for keeping them engaged and assessing their needs 
and pain points. Due to the costs involved, it is not possible to target all the clients of the company. Along 
with the marketing team, the officers would like to understand why customers are leaving the bank and
find the most probable churners."

## Tasks
* Identify the most probable clients that will churn in the future – who are the customers that will 
leave the company?
* Identify & explain churn drivers – what are the most important factors in churn?

## Steps

### Data Preparation: 
* Missing values imputation
* Categorical encoding
* Discretization
* Remove duplicated, constant, quasi-constant features
* Feature transformation
* Outliers treatment
* Feature scaling

### Model Development:
* Train ML model that solves the business need
* Test different algorithms
* Test different set of parameters
* Asses technical performance of the model

### Model Explainability:
* Interpret model results
* Asses feature importance and impact
